# Intro
- pose the questions up front
- emphasis on methods that learn structure rather than those that assume it is given

# Outline 
- why we discuss model-free before model based

# Model-Free HRL

## Top-down Methods

### Sub-Task Methods

## Bottom-up Methods

### Latent Variable Methods

# Model-Based HRL
