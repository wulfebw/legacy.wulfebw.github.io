description: Approachable tutorial on Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
---

# Intro
- We just made public an [implementation](https://github.com/sisl/hgail) of [generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03476) in [rllab](https://github.com/rll/rllab) environments, and also an [environment](https://github.com/sisl/ngsim_env) for training human driver models
- I noticed that there doesn't seem to be an approachable tutorial on GAIL online, so that's what this attempts to be

# The Problem
