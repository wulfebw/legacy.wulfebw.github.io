<p class="about-p">
I recently completed a master's degree in computer science at Stanford. I'm interested in reinforcement learning and decision making, and performed research on these topics as part of the <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/sisl/cgi-bin/wordpress/people/" class="md-link">Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory</a> advised by <a class="md-link" href="http://mykel.kochenderfer.com/">Mykel Kochenderfer</a>. My research primarily focused on policy learning and evaluation in autonomous UAV and automotive applications.

I interned at Adobe Research during summer 2017 with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hung-bui-2a9b244" class="md-link">Hung Bui</a> and others developing a system for learning to automate user behaviors from demonstration. We used generative adversarial imitation learning to learn to draw sketches using few examples, and proposed a hierarchical variant exhibiting improved transfer performance.

As an undergraduate student I studied computer science at Vanderbilt University, where I performed autonomous UAV research with my advisor <a href="http://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/julie-adams" class="md-link">Julie Adams</a> as part of the <a href="http://eecs.vanderbilt.edu/research/hmtl/wp/" class="md-link">Human-Machine Teaming Lab</a>. I also did an independent study advised by <a href="http://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/eugene-vorobeychik" class="md-link">Eugene Vorobeychik</a> dealing with social interaction analysis, which is how I originally became interested in machine learning.
