description: Project outline for building a robotic arm and controlling it with reinforcement learning
---

## Outline
- This project consists of building a robotic arm with visual perception, and learning to control it through reinforcement and imitation learning 
- Here's the breakdown of the task:

1. [LED control](https://wulfebw.github.io/blog/rl/robotics/led-control)
2. Single-servo control
3. One-link revolute joint control 
4. End-effector programmatic control 
5. End-effector RL control
6. End-effector manual control 
7. End-effector imitation control
8. Multi-servo programmatic control 
9. Multi-servo RL control
10. Two-link revolute joint control 
11. Building the 6 dof robotic arm 
12. Robotic arm programmatic control 
13. Robotic arm manual control 
14. Robotic arm imitation control
15. Robotic arm RL control 
16. Perception
17. Robotic arm with vision manual control
18. Robotic arm with vision imitation control
19. Robotic arm with vision RL control 
20. Robotic arm with vision RL control through transfer from simulation

## What is this?
- this is an outline for a project
- the project is to build a robotic arm and control it via reinforcement and imitation learning 

## Why am I doing this project?
- RL and stochastic dynamic programming have been successful in performing a number of tasks like game playing and robotics
- Most RL (human) learning resources focus on implementing algorithms and applying them in simulation 
- Real-world robotics is a key application area of reinforcement learning because it is a case where RL is very likely the best option for learning control policies 
- The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of RL in a robotics task
    + In a manner that people could do by themselves at reasonable cost without external resources like a robotics lab
